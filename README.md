## Structure

As this is a pretty small site with few moving parts it's just structured in the default vue cli way. Components are not split into different folders for each view. The component names will all start with the view that they are used in. Modules are not used as they would probably just be overkill for this (and I haven't learned how to use them in vue yet).

This also attemps to use the [vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/)

Component naming system comes from [here](https://itnext.io/how-to-structure-a-vue-js-project-29e4ddc1aeeb)
